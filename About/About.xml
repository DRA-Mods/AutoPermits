A mod which allows for Royal permits granting resources to be used automatically whenever they can be used for free.

The auto-use of permits can be configured separately for each of your colonists, as well as each of their permits. The menu can be accessed from the "Call aid..." menu (while on a map) or a separate button (while caravaning).

On top of deciding which permits will be used you can also decide if the permits will be used on caravans, as well as if they should only be used on player (non-quest) maps.

The permits will only be used the moment their cooldown ends - assuming that your colonist would be able to call permits at the time (so they're concious, not in cryptosleep pod, etc.) - so you'll need to use them for the first time, and then they'll be sent automatically afterwards. Please note, resources won't be sent to caravans if it would put them over their carry capacity.

Includes compat for Vanilla Factions Expanded - Empire (stone drop needs special handling). Should be compatible with Trade Ships Drop Spot by Smash Phil - the resources should drop on the spot added by the mod.
